# SentiMind: A High-Accuracy Sentiment Analysis Web Application
#
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]
#
# Description:
# This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for sentiment
# analysis. It leverages a state-of-the-art, pre-trained RoBERTa model from the
# Hugging Face Transformers library to deliver highly accurate predictions
# on user-provided text.
# =================================================================================

# --- 1. IMPORTS ---
# Import necessary libraries.
# Streamlit is for creating the web app interface.
# Transformers/PyTorch are for loading and running the AI model.
import streamlit as st
from transformers import pipeline

# --- 2. SETUP & CONFIGURATION ---
# Configure the Streamlit page. This must be the first Streamlit command.

# --- 3. MODEL LOADING ---
# Use a caching decorator to prevent the model from being reloaded on every
# user interaction, which significantly improves app performance.
